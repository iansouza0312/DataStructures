# Data Structures Study with C and C++

Welcome to the Data Structures Study repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and implement various data structures using the C and C++ programming languages. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to brush up on your skills, this repository offers a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing fundamental data structures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on different types of data structures. Each directory contains source files (.c or .cpp), headers (.h), and README files to guide you through the implementation and usage of the data structures.

## Key Directories

- Arrays: Explore static and dynamic arrays, including common operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Linked Lists: Dive into singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, with examples and explanations of various operations.
- Stacks: Learn about stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, along with typical stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
- Queues: Understand the workings of queues, including circular queues and priority queues, implemented with both arrays and linked lists.
- Trees: Study binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and other tree structures, complete with insertion, deletion, and traversal algorithms.
- Graphs: Implement graph representations using adjacency lists and matrices, and explore algorithms for traversal (BFS, DFS) and shortest paths (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall).
- Hash Tables: Learn about hash table implementations, collision handling techniques like chaining and open addressing, and real-world applications.
